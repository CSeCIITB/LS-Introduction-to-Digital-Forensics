# Unknown File

Remember that suspicious lizard? I knew something was up with it! I picked it up and brought it to my house and kept it enclosed in a container... only to wake up the next day to find the lizard gone and floppy disk inside the container. I have so many questions!!!! How did the lizard disappear? How did a floppy disk enter the contaner and where did it come from? </br>
Being a old-school hacker, I possessed a floppy-drive reader. I inserted the floppy disk and opened it on my Commodore-64 to discover a solitray file in it... but what do I do with it? I am already having enough chills down my spine to think straight, so I'll leave that up to you! Let's get to the end of this, comrade!
