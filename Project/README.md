# The Final Project

## Part 1 - Brainfuck Interpreter

Use Python, C, or C++ to write a program that takes in the name of a file containing Brainfuck code and executes the code in that file. You are essentially creating a program to "execute" Brainfuck code.<br>
To learn about how Brainfuck code is written, and to see examples, refer to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) page.

**Note:** You may assume that the code given to the program has no errors.
