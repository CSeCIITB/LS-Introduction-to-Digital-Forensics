  I'm trying to develop a habit of writing diary, if not at least some weird instances that I think I would understand better if I spent some time thinking about them.

I could understand some instances as a part of basic human psychology, but some I just couldn't understand them! I wonder if they're trying to tell me something though or they're just some random incidents :thonk:

(TL;DR)

This zip file contains descriptions of some instances. Find the hidden message in each instance to assemble the complete flag! PS: the password to the zip file is my favorite community of IITB ;-) (in all small) <br> 

Flag Format: YoS{...}
