In this challenge, you've been given a protected PDF file and a hash. That's all you need to find the flag - besides, of course, a little magic element that you should possess to make your way through YoS!

First, identify the type of hashing algorithm used. Next, crack the hash to reveal the "magic element" we spoke of. The password for the PDF file is in the format <magic_element>_<hashing_algorithm_name>. (Write the name of the hashing algorithm as only capital letters and/or numbers; no special characters)

If you think you've got that magic element in you, unlock the PDF file to obtain the flag.

(Hint: There are tools for both the above tasks.)

Flag Format: YoS{...}
